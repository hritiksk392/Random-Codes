# Database-System-Normalization-Application

## Overview
A Java based GUI application that for a given set of Attributes and Functional Dependencies can identify candidate keys and check the highest normal form it satisfies.
If the highest normal form is X it can decompose the given relation to satisfy X+1 Normal Form upto **BCNF Normal Form**.

The application has been made using NetBeans IDE 8.2 and written entirely in Java (v. 1.8.0_231).The source code for the project can be found in the src/mymod1 directory. The source code has been appropriately commented wherever found necessary.

## Preview:
Below is the preview of different functionalities of the application.
### Instructions for Inputs
* All the input Attributes should be seperated by a comma ','.
* For each functional dependency the left attributes and the right attributes should be seperated using a single arrow '->'.
* New functional dependencies should be added from a new line ("Press Enter").
